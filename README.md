## üëÄ Overview

BFP provides a solver for Boltzman Fokker-Plank charged-particle transport problems, seamlessly integrating with: 
[PyMFEM](https://github.com/mfem/PyMFEM): Python wrapper for MFEM library, supporting FEM simulations.
[PyGLVis](https://github.com/GLVis/pyglvis). Interactive visualization tool for finite element methods, designed especially for Jupyter notebooks.

This package simplifies setup and visualization of BFP simulations, designed specifically for Charged Particle Transport Problems.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/melekderman/BFP.git
cd BFP
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Python Environment

We recommend using a virtual or Conda environment.

#### Virtual Environment

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Conda Environment

```bash
conda create --name BFP-env python==3.11
conda activate BFP-env
```
### Step 3: Install BFP

Install BFP along with dependencies using:

```bash
pip install .
```
## üìà Usage & Visualization

BFP integrates with **PyGLVis**, which is a Jupyter-compatible visualization toolkit. To effectively visualize results:

### In a Jupyter notebook, initialize PyGLVis:

```python
import glvis
glvis(mesh, solution)
```
Refer to the PyGLVis Documentation: [PyGLVis](https://github.com/GLVis/pyglvis) for more examples.

## üî¨ Running Tests

After installation, run the provided tests to verify your setup.

#### Serial Testing

```bash
cd tests/unit/
python test_coeff.py
python test_mesh.py
```

#### Parallel Testing *(upcoming feature)*

```bash
python test_coeff.py --parallel
python test_mesh.py --parallel
```
